  "summary": "Implemented a shared contact constants module and updated LandingPage, ContactSection, and Footer to use the centralized phone/tel/email/address values. The diff does not provide enough evidence to confirm that all remaining old phone-number occurrences across the entire frontend (including frontend/index.html and all TSX files) were removed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Scan the entire frontend codebase and static HTML for any remaining occurrences of the old phone numbers and replace them everywhere with the correct numbers (including updating tel: links), ensuring a full-text search returns zero matches for the old numbers.",
      "reason": "The diff shows updates in three components and the addition of a constants file, but does not show evidence of a project-wide scan/replacement (e.g., no changes shown for frontend/index.html and no evidence that other TSX files outside the three modified components were checked/updated).",
